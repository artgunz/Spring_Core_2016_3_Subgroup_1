To test work:

1) You can initDB with random test values or\and load some data: for now only Auditoriums could be loaded. Test CSV files could be founded in 'samples' folder
 a) http://localhost:8080/cinema/testinit
 b) http://localhost:8080/multiUpload or http://localhost:8080/singleUpload or http://localhost:8080/upload
2) You can show users' tickets :
 a) http://localhost:8080/user/onatoley@email.com/tickets/list
 b) http://localhost:8080/user/onatoley@email.com/tickets/list.pdf
3) You can see errors handling

Sorry for bugs and for not fully done homework. I hadn't enough time for that =(((
